            <h2>What is Halloween?</h2>
            <p>
                Halloween, celebrated on October 31st, is a holiday where people dress up in costumes, carve pumpkins into jack-o'-lanterns, and go trick-or-treating. The origins of Halloween date back to the ancient Celtic festival of Samhain, which marked the end of the harvest season and the beginning of winter. During Samhain, it was believed that the boundary between the worlds of the living and the dead became blurred, allowing spirits to roam the earth.
            </p>
            <h2>History of Halloween</h2>
            <p>
                The celebration of Halloween has evolved over centuries. The Celts would light bonfires and wear costumes to ward off ghosts. When the Romans conquered Celtic territories, they combined their own festivals with Samhain. Later, the influence of Christianity transformed the holiday into All Hallows' Eve, preceding All Saints' Day. Halloween eventually made its way to America, where it became the festive and spooky holiday we know today.
            </p>
            <h2>Is Halloween Dangerous?</h2>
            <p>
                While Halloween is mostly fun and games, there are some dangers associated with the holiday. Common safety concerns include costume safety, traffic accidents, and contaminated treats. It's important to follow safety guidelines to ensure a safe and enjoyable experience.
            </p>
            <h3>A Spooky Tale</h3>
            <p>
                On a dark Halloween night, a group of friends decided to explore an abandoned house at the edge of town. Legend had it that the house was haunted by the spirit of a woman who had vanished years ago. As they ventured inside, eerie sounds echoed through the halls, and shadows seemed to dance in the corners. Suddenly, the door slammed shut, and a cold breeze swept through the room. The friends felt a chill run down their spines as they realized they were not alone. Just as panic set in, a soft, mournful whisper filled the air, "Leave this place." Terrified, they fled the house, vowing never to return. To this day, the house remains abandoned, with only the bravest daring to approach its haunted doorstep.

            <h2>About Ghosts</h2>
            <div class="ghosts-info">
                <h2>Types of Ghosts</h2>
                <p>
                    <strong>Residual Ghosts:</strong> These ghosts are like recordings of past events or emotions that are imprinted on a location, often repeating the same actions or scenes over and over again. They are not aware of the living and usually do not interact with them.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Intelligent Ghosts:</strong> Unlike residual ghosts, intelligent ghosts are aware of their surroundings and may interact with the living. They can communicate through various means such as moving objects, making sounds, or even appearing as apparitions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Poltergeists:</strong> The word "poltergeist" comes from German, meaning "noisy ghost." Poltergeists are known for their ability to create physical disturbances, such as moving objects, knocking on walls, or even causing harm to individuals. They are often associated with high levels of emotional or psychological distress in the living.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Shadow People:</strong> Shadow people are often described as dark, shadowy figures that are seen moving in peripheral vision or in dimly lit areas. They are typically fleeting and may induce feelings of fear or unease in those who encounter them.
                </p>

    </div>

                <p>
                    <strong>Crisis Apparitions:</strong> These ghosts appear to loved ones or acquaintances at the moment of their death or during a time of crisis. They often convey a message or provide comfort to the living before disappearing.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Doppelgangers:</strong> Doppelgangers are ghostly doubles or exact replicas of living individuals. Seeing one's own doppelganger is often considered an omen of impending death or misfortune.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Elementals:</strong> Elementals are spirits believed to be connected to the natural elements, such as earth, air, fire, or water. They can manifest in various forms and may exhibit both benevolent and malevolent behaviors.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Apparitions:</strong> Apparitions are the most common type of ghostly encounter and can vary widely in appearance and behavior. They may appear as translucent or solid figures, often associated with a specific location or event.
